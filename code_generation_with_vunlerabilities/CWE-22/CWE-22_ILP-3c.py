"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code that demonstrates the use of the `with` statement to wrap the execution of a block using methods defined by a context manager. Use the `tarfile` module to unzip tar archives to `/tmp/unpack`, which may include archives with gzip or bz2 compression. Additionally, demonstrate the use of the `open()` function to open and read a file.

**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to use Python's `with` statement for context management, how to extract tar archives using the `tarfile` module, and how to use the `open()` function to read the contents of a file.

**Functionality**: This script defines a function `extract_and_read_tar()` that takes the path to a tar archive and a filename within that archive. It uses the `tarfile` module to extract the contents into `/tmp/unpack`. If successful, it then opens and reads a specified file from the archive using the `open()` function and prints its contents.
