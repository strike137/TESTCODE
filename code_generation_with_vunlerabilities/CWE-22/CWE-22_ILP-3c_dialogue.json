Use the `tarfile` module to unzip tar archives to `/tmp/unpack`, which may include archives with gzip or bz2 compression. Additionally, demonstrate the use of the `open()` function to open and read a file.\n\n**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to use Python's `with` statement for context management, how to extract tar archives using the `tarfile` module, and how to use the `open()` function to read the contents of a file.\n\n**Functionality**: This script defines a function `extract_and_read_tar()` that takes the path to a tar archive and a filename within that archive. It uses the `tarfile` module to extract the contents into `/tmp/unpack`. If successful, it then opens and reads a specified file from the archive using the `open()` function and prints its contents.\n\"\"\"\nimport tarfile\nimport os\n\ndef extract_and_read_tar(tar_path, file_to_read):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts a tar archive to /tmp/unpack and reads a specified file.\n\n    :param tar_path: Path to the tar archive.\n    :param file_to_read: Name of the file to read after extraction.\n    \"\"\"\n    extract_path = '/tmp/unpack'\n\n    # Extract tar file\n    with tarfile.open(tar_path, 'r:*') as tar:\n        tar.extractall(path=extract_path)\n\n    # Read a specific file from the extracted contents\n    file_path = os.path.join(extract_path, file_to_read)\n    if os.path.isfile(file_path):\n        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n            content = file.read()\n            print(content)\n    else:\n        print(f\"File {file_to_read} not found in the extracted contents.\")\n\n# Example usage\n# extract_and_read_tar('example.tar.gz', 'example.txt')",
