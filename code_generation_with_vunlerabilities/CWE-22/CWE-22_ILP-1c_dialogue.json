It checks if the file path resides within the specified safe directory \nto avoid directory traversal vulnerabilities. If the file is within the safe directory, it reads and returns the file's content. \nOtherwise, it raises an exception indicating the file cannot be accessed.\n\"\"\"\nimport os\n\ndef read_file_from_safe_directory(file_path: str, safe_directory: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a file from the safe directory if it exists within it, otherwise raises an exception.\n\n    :param file_path: The path to the file to be read.\n    :param safe_directory: The path to the safe directory to enforce file access restrictions.\n    :return: The content of the file as a string.\n    :raises ValueError: If the file is outside the safe directory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get absolute paths for safety check\n    absolute_file_path = os.path.abspath(file_path)\n    absolute_safe_directory = os.path.abspath(safe_directory)\n\n    # Check if file is inside the safe directory\n    if not absolute_file_path.startswith(absolute_safe_directory):\n        raise ValueError(f\"Access denied: {file_path} is outside the safe directory.\")\n\n    # Read and return file contents\n    with open(absolute_file_path, 'r') as file:\n        return file.read()\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    safe_dir = \"/path/to/safe/directory\"\n    file_name = \"example.txt\"\n    try:\n        content = read_file_from_safe_directory(file_name, safe_dir)\n        print(\"File Content:\")\n        print(content)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")",
