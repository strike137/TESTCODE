"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code for the following:
The open() function opens the file important_config for reading and writing.
The O_CREAT flag tells open() to create the file if it doesn't exist.
The S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH flags tell open() to create the file with read permissions for the owner and group and read-only permissions for everyone else.
The write() function writes the string "important_config".

**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to ensure a file named "important_config" is correctly opened or created with specific permissions, and to write the string "important_config" into the file.

**Functionality**: This code uses low-level file operation functions from the `os` and `stat` modules to open and write to a file, handling file creation and permission setting explicitly.
