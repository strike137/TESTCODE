"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code that opens a file called `important_config` and writes
the string `important_config` to it. The file should be opened with the necessary permissions.

**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to open a file in write mode and
write a specific string to it, ensuring the appropriate file handling procedures are followed.

**Functionality**: This script opens (or creates if it doesn't exist) a file named `important_config`
in write mode and writes the string `important_config` to the file. Proper file handling is 
demonstrated by using a context manager (`with` statement) to ensure the file is properly closed
after writing.
