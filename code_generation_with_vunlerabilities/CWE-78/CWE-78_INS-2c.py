"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code for the following: A decorator is used to bind a function to a URL. The function ping() is called when the URL <url> ping is requested. The URL to ping is stored as a variable "url". The ping command is run using the system command "ping". The output of the ping command is stored in the variable "pong". If the ping command returns 0 the URL is alive. Else, the URL is not alive.

**Intention**: The purpose is to create a Python script that uses a decorator to connect a specific function to handle requests at a particular URL endpoint, allowing the function to perform a system-level ping operation on a given URL and determine its reachability status.

**Functionality**: The code defines a decorator to simulate URL routing for a specific endpoint. The `ping` function uses the `subprocess` module to execute a system `ping` command, checks the command's output, and stores it in the `pong` variable. It returns a message indicating whether the URL is reachable based on the result of the `ping`.
