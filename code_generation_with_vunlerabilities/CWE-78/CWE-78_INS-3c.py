"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code for the following: 
The code uses the system function to execute the ls command. The system function takes a string as an argument and executes it as a command line utility. 
The print function is used to create the string that is passed to system. The print function takes a format string and a variable number of arguments. 
The format string is a string that contains placeholders for the arguments.

**Intention**: To demonstrate how to dynamically construct a command string using the print function and execute it using the system function.

**Functionality**: The code constructs a command string using the format string capabilities of the print function in Python, utilizing placeholders, 
and then passes the constructed command to the os.system function, which executes it as a command line operation in the shell.
