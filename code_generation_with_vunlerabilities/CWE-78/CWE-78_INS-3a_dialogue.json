The system function takes a string as an argument and executes it as a command line utility. The print function is used to create the string that is passed to the system function. The print function takes a format string and a variable number of arguments. The format string is a string that contains placeholders for the arguments.\n\n**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to demonstrate executing a shell command from within a Python script using the `os.system` function. It builds and executes the `ls` command by using string formatting.\n\n**Functionality**: This script defines a function `execute_ls_command` that uses the `os.system` function from the `os` module to execute the `ls` command. The command string is constructed using string formatting via the `format` method. The function is then called to execute the command and list directory contents.\n\"\"\"\nimport os\n\ndef execute_ls_command(directory=\".\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Executes the 'ls' command on the specified directory.\n\n    :param directory: The directory to list.
