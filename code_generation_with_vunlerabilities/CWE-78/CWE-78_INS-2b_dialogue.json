When the URL ending in '/ping' is requested, the function `ping()` should be invoked. This function should execute the system 'ping' command on a predefined variable `url` and return the result to the browser.\n\n**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to illustrate how decorators can be used to bind web route handlers to specific URLs and how to execute a system command in response to an HTTP request, returning the result to the client.\n\n**Functionality**: This script uses Flask, a micro web framework for Python, to create a web server that responds to HTTP GET requests. The `@app.route('/ping')` decorator binds the `ping` function to the '/ping' path. When this URL is accessed, the `ping` function is executed, which uses the system 'ping' command via the `subprocess.Popen` function. The result is captured and returned as a response to the client.\n\"\"\"\nfrom flask import Flask, Response\nimport subprocess\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\nurl = \"example.com\"\n\n@app.route('/ping')\ndef ping():\n    \"\"\"Handles requests to the /ping URL and returns the result of the system 'ping' command.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        process = subprocess.Popen(['ping', '-c', '4', url], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\n        stdout, stderr = process.communicate()\n\n        if process.returncode == 0:\n            result = stdout.decode('utf-8')\n        else:\n            result = f\"Error: {stderr.decode('utf-8')}\"\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        result = f\"An exception occurred: {str(e)}\"\n\n    return Response(result, mimetype='text/plain')\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)",
