If the checksum is 0, then the buffer is empty. The number of bytes read and the checksum are saved to another file.\n\n**Intention**: \nThe purpose of this code is to read the contents of a specified file, compute the checksum of these contents to determine if the file is empty, and log the results (number of bytes read and computed checksum) into another output file.\n\n**Functionality**: \nThe code defines two functions: `calculate_checksum` and `process_file`. The `calculate_checksum` function takes a data buffer as input and returns the checksum by summing up the bytes. The `process_file` function reads the contents of a specified input file into a buffer, calculates its checksum using `calculate_checksum`, and writes the number of bytes read and the checksum into a specified output file.\n\"\"\"\ndef calculate_checksum(data):\n    \"\"\"Calculate and return the checksum of a given data buffer.\"\"\"\n    return sum(data)\n\ndef process_file(input_file_path, output_file_path):\n    \"\"\"Read the input file, calculate checksum, and write results to the output file.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(input_file_path, 'rb') as input_file:\n            buffer = input_file.read()\n            checksum = calculate_checksum(buffer)\n            num_bytes = len(buffer)\n        \n        with open(output_file_path, 'w') as output_file:\n            output_file.write(f\"Number of bytes read: {num_bytes}\\n\")\n            output_file.write(f\"Checksum: {checksum}\\n\")\n    except (IOError, FileNotFoundError) as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# Example Usage\n# process_file('input.txt', 'output.txt')",
