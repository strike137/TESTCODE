"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code for the following: 
The code allocates two chunks of memory each of size 10.
It then copies the contents of the first chunk into the second chunk.
It then frees the first chunk.
It then frees the second chunk.

**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to simulate the allocation, manipulation, and deallocation of memory chunks in Python, mimicking lower-level operations typically performed in languages like C.

**Functionality**: The code utilizes Python lists to simulate memory allocation.
- Two lists of size 10 are created, representing memory chunks.
- The first chunk is filled with arbitrary values.
- The contents of the first chunk are copied into the second chunk.
- Both chunks are set to `None` to simulate freeing the memory.
