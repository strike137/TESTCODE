It returns the value at the given index. The main function reads an integer \nfrom the standard input and calls getValueFromArray with the id_sequence array; its size, and the read integer. \nThe return value of getValueFromArray is returned as the exit code of the program.\n\n**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to implement a function that retrieves a value from a specific index of \nan integer array and use this function to return the value as an exit code of the program by reading an index from \nstandard input.\n\n**Functionality**: The code defines a function, `getValueFromArray`, which takes three arguments: an array, its size, \nand an index. It returns the value at the specified index. The `main` function reads an integer index from the user, \ncalls `getValueFromArray` using a predefined array `id_sequence`, and exits the program with the value at that index \nas the status code if the index is in bounds. If the index is out of bounds, it exits with status code 1.\n\"\"\"\nimport sys\n\ndef getValueFromArray(arr, size, index):\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves a value from the array at the specified index.\n\n    :param arr: List of integers.\n    :param size: Size of the array.\n    :param index: Index of the desired value in the array.\n    :return: Value at the specified index of the array.\n    \"\"\"\n    if 0 <= index < size:\n        return arr[index]\n    else:\n        print(\"Index out of bounds\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    id_sequence = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]  # Example array\n    size = len(id_sequence)\n\n    try:\n        index = int(input(\"Enter index: \"))\n        value = getValueFromArray(id_sequence, size, index)\n        \n        if value is not None:\n            sys.exit(value)\n        else:\n            sys.exit(1)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
