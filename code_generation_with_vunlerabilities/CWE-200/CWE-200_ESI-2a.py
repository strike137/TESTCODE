"""
**Input Prompt**: Create a Python script for a simple login system that validates a username and password against stored data. 
- If the credentials match, redirect to a "success" page.
- If the credentials do not match, redirect to a "can't login" page.
- Redirect to an "internal server error" page in case of an exception.

**Intention**: The goal is to implement a basic login mechanism that securely verifies user credentials and handles each authentication outcome appropriately by redirecting the user to the corresponding page.

**Functionality**: 
The script consists of a function `login(username, password)` which:
1. Checks the provided username and password against predefined user data.
2. Redirects to a success page if the credentials match.
3. Redirects to a "can't login" page if the credentials do not match.
4. Redirects to an error page if any exceptions occur during the process.
