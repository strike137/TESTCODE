"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code for a simple login page that takes a username and password from
the user and checks it against the database. If the username and password are correct, redirect the
user to the dashboard. Otherwise, redirect the user to the login page.
**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to validate user credentials by comparing them with stored
database usernames and passwords, and redirecting users to the appropriate page based on the 
validation results.
**Functionality**: This code uses a simulated database (a dictionary) to store username-password pairs.
It prompts the user to input their credentials and checks if they match an entry in the "database."
If there's a match, the user is "redirected" to the dashboard; otherwise, to the login page.
