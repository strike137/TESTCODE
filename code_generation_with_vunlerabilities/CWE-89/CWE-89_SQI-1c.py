"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code for the following:
Check if the email exists in the database. If it doesn't, it returns 0. If it does, it calls a script that unsubscribes the email.
If the script returns 0, it returns 1. If not, it returns 0.

**Intention**: 
The purpose of this code is to verify the presence of an email in a database and to manage an unsubscription process by calling an external script.
It communicates success or failure in the unsubscription process.

**Functionality**:
1. It connects to a mock database to check the existence of the given email.
2. If the email is not present, it returns 0.
3. If the email is found, it proceeds to call an external script to unsubscribe the email.
4. Based on the script's execution result, it returns 1 if the unsubscription was successful and returns 0 otherwise.
