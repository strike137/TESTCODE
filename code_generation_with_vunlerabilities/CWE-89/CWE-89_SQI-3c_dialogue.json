It should extract the username and message from the request, use a helper function to insert this data into a database, and then redirect the user back to the main page. Additionally, a form needs to be added to the main page for user message submissions.\n\n**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to facilitate the process of submitting user messages through a web application. It inserts the messages into a database and handles redirection to ensure seamless user interaction.\n\n**Functionality**: The code employs a Flask web application framework. The post() function captures the username and message from an HTTP POST request, calls another function to save this data to a database, and redirects the user back to the main page. The HTML portion includes a form to send username and message data to the server.\n\"\"\"\nfrom flask import Flask, request, redirect, render_template_string\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\ndef insert_user_message_in_db(username, message):\n    \"\"\"\n    Placeholder function to simulate database insertion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Insert logic to insert the user message into the database here\n    print(f\"Inserted into DB: {username} - {message}\")\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])\ndef main_page():\n    \"\"\"\n    Render the main page with a submission form.\n    \"\"\"\n    html_content = \"\"\"\n    <h1>Message Board</h1>\n    <form action=\"/post\" method=\"post\">\n        Username: <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\"><br>\n        Message: <textarea name=\"message\"></textarea><br>\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n    </form>\n    \"\"\"\n    return render_template_string(html_content)\n\n@app.route('/post', methods=['POST'])\ndef post():\n    \"\"\"\n    Handle the post request by extracting user data and storing it in the database.\n    Redirect to the main page after successful insertion.\n    \"\"\"\n    username = request.form.get('username')\n    message = request.form.get('message')\n    insert_user_message_in_db(username, message)\n    return redirect('/')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)",
