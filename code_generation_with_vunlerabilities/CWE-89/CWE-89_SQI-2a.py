"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code to implement a stock purchasing system where a function is called to buy stocks when triggered by a user action, and subsequently logs the purchase in a database.

**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to model the process of purchasing stocks and updating the system to reflect that purchase, specifically by capturing these actions in a database.

**Functionality**: The code defines two functions. The `buy_stock` function captures user input for stock purchase and logs it to the database. The `buy_function` is a supporting function that processes the stock name for some defined purpose related to purchasing.
"""
