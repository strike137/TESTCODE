"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code for a memory allocation method that allocates a block of memory of a specified size and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block. The code should also allocate a new person and set their status to 0.
**Intention**: To create a Python representation of a memory allocation process and initialize an object representing a person with a default status.
**Functionality**: This script defines a `Person` class to simulate the object structure and a function `allocate_person` to create an instance of `Person`, mimicking memory allocation by returning a reference to the new object.
