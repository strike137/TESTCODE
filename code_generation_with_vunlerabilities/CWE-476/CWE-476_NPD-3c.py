"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code that includes a method for memory allocation to create a buffer of 1024 bytes 
and another function to read 10 characters from standard input and stores them in the buffer.
**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to allocate a memory buffer of a fixed size and populate it 
with input from a user.
**Functionality**: The code defines a function to allocate a 1024-byte buffer and another function to read exactly 10 
characters from the standard input, writing them into the allocated buffer. It manages the buffer size to ensure 
it does not exceed the allocated memory.
