"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code for memory allocation that allocates a block of memory of size sizeof(person) and returns a pointer to the beginning of that block.

**Intention**: The task is to simulate the behavior of memory allocation in C programming within a Python context, where we traditionally don't manage memory allocation directly. The aim here is to represent how Python might handle such a memory allocation pattern using its constructs.

**Functionality**: This code defines a `Person` class and creates an instance of it to simulate allocating memory for a `Person` object. It uses Python's `ctypes` library to mimic memory allocation behavior as seen in lower-level languages like C. The code prints the memory address of the allocated object to demonstrate how a pointer might be represented in Python.
