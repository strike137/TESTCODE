"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code for the following: 
Memory allocation method allocates a block of memory of size sizeof(person)
and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block. The code allocates a new
person and sets the status field to 0.

**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to simulate the memory allocation 
process in a structured manner within Python by creating a new instance of a 
'Person' class and setting its 'status' attribute to 0. 

**Functionality**: The code defines a 'Person' class with an attribute 'status'.
It provides a method to allocate a new instance of a 'Person' object (simulating
memory allocation) and sets the 'status' attribute to 0 to reflect the intended
behavior of the original prompt regarding memory operations.
"""
class Person:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the status field to 0
        self.status = 0

def allocate_new_person():
    """
    Allocate a new Person object and return it.
    This simulates memory allocation for a Person.
