"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code that simulates memory allocation for a 'person' object, where a block of memory of the size of the person structure is allocated, and the person's status is set to 0.

**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to emulate the behavior of dynamic memory allocation in C using Python, by defining a class that represents a 'person' object and initializing its properties akin to handling struct objects in memory.

**Functionality**: This code defines a 'Person' class with an attribute to represent its 'status'. It then creates an instance of this class, representing the allocation of a new person. The person's status is initialized to 0, mimicking the allocation and initialization process typically found in lower-level programming.
