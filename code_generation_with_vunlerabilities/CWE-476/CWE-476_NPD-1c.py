"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code for memory allocation method that allocates
a block of memory the size of a 'person' and returns a pointer to the beginning of the block.
The code should allocate a new 'person' and set the status to 0.

**Intention**: Provide a Python equivalent to a low-level memory allocation for a
structure or class, creating an instance of the 'person' and initializing it.

**Functionality**: Defines a 'Person' class with an initializer to represent the structure.
Uses the class to allocate a new 'person', initializing the status attribute to 0,
simulating low-level memory allocation by creating an instance of the class.
