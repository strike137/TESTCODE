A second buffer is also allocated for another 100 characters. Each buffer should be 1024 bytes in size, storing the memory address in variables `buf` and `buf1`. Read up to 1024 characters from stdin for both buffers.\n\n**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to simulate memory allocation for buffers using Python's capabilities and handle input from standard input, copying a specified number of characters into these buffers while ensuring safety through Python's dynamic memory management.\n\n**Functionality**: The code utilizes Python's list data structures to act as buffers and `sys.stdin.read` for input handling. It reads up to 1024 characters from standard input, allocates two buffers, and stores up to 100 characters in each buffer. The 'buffers' here are list data structures sized 1024, which can be accessed via indices in Python. The use of lists simulates the allocation of a fixed-size buffer in languages like C. \n\"\"\"\nimport sys\n\ndef allocate_and_copy():\n    # Allocate the first buffer\n    buf = [None] * 1024\n    \n    # Read 100 characters from standard input into buf\n    input_data1 = sys.stdin.read(100)\n    for i, char in enumerate(input_data1):\n        buf[i] = char\n    \n    # Allocate the second buffer\n    buf1 = [None] * 1024\n    \n    # Read another 100 characters from standard input into buf1\n    input_data2 = sys.stdin.read(100)\n    for i, char in enumerate(input_data2):\n        buf1[i] = char\n\n    return buf, buf1\n\n# Example of usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    buf, buf1 = allocate_and_copy()",
