The input will include the destination, the source, and the number of bytes to be copied. Additionally, demonstrate the function by copying the string \"Hello\" into a buffer and display the buffer's contents.\n\n**Intention**: \nThe purpose of the code is to simulate a memory copy operation using Python, where bytes from a source string are copied into a destination buffer up to a specified length. This illustrates a low-level operation typically done in languages like C but implemented in Python.\n\n**Functionality**: \nThe code defines a function `copy_memory` that takes three arguments: `destination` (bytearray), `source` (bytes or string), and `num_bytes` (int). It performs the byte copy operation by iterating over the range of `num_bytes` and copying each byte from the source to the destination. The demonstration creates a bytearray buffer, uses `copy_memory` to copy the string \"Hello\" to this buffer, and prints the buffer to show the result.\n\"\"\"\ndef copy_memory(destination: bytearray, source: bytes, num_bytes: int) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Copies a specified number of bytes from the source to the destination.\n\n    :param destination: The bytearray to copy bytes into.\n    :param source: The bytes or string to copy from.\n    :param num_bytes: The number of bytes to copy.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(min(num_bytes, len(source))):\n        destination[i] = source[i]\n\n# Example usage\nsource_string = b\"Hello\"\nbuffer = bytearray(10)\ncopy_memory(buffer, source_string, len(source_string))\n\nprint(buffer)",
