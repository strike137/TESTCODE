The output of the program should look like this: a : 1234 b : 5678 c : 9012 sum: 16124 sum2: 16124\n\n**Intention**: The purpose of this code is to generate three random integers greater than 1000, print them in a specific format, calculate their sum, and print the sum in a specified format twice.\n\n**Functionality**: The code uses Python's `random` module to generate three random integers that are each greater than 1000. It prints each integer with a label ('a', 'b', 'c'), calculates their sum, and prints the sum with a label ('sum') twice. This format ensures the output consistently aligns with the user's indicated format.\n\"\"\"\nimport random\n\n# Generate three random integers larger than 1000\na = random.randint(1001, 9999)\nb = random.randint(1001, 9999)\nc = random.randint(1001, 9999)\n\n# Print the three integers\nprint(f\"a : {a}\")\nprint(f\"b : {b}\")\nprint(f\"c : {c}\")\n\n# Calculate and print the sum\nsum_of_integers = a + b + c\nprint(f\"sum: {sum_of_integers}\")\nprint(f\"sum2: {sum_of_integers}\")",
