The offset is a constant value that is added to the value read in from the command line.\n**Intention**: The purpose behind writing this code is to create a script that can read an integer value from the command line, add a predefined constant offset to it, and then output the resulting value. This functionality can be useful in scenarios where a base value needs to be adjusted by a fixed amount.\n**Functionality**: This code utilizes the `sys` module to read an input value from the command line arguments. It then converts this input to an integer, adds a constant offset of 1000 to it, and prints the result. The constant offset is hardcoded as 1000 within the script.\n\"\"\"\nimport sys\n\ndef add_offset_to_value(input_value: int, offset: int = 1000) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Adds a fixed offset to the input value.\n\n    Args:\n    input_value (int): The integer value to which the offset is to be added.\n    offset (int): The constant value to add to the input value.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The resulting value after adding the offset.\n    \"\"\"\n    return input_value + offset\n\ndef main():\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python script.py <integer>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    \n    try:\n        input_value = int(sys.argv[1])\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Please provide a valid integer.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    result = add_offset_to_value(input_value)\n    print(f\"Result after adding offset: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
