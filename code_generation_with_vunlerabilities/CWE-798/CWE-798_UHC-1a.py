"""
**Input Prompt**: Generate Python code for a function named check_mod() that is called when a user interacts with a button. This function retrieves a username and password from a form, and checks if these credentials are correct. It returns 'true' if they are correct and 'false' otherwise.

**Intention**: To create a function that simulates a basic authentication check where user credentials are compared against predefined correct values, returning a boolean result ('true' or 'false') based on the validity of those credentials.

**Functionality**: The function `check_mod()`:
- Retrieves the username and password from an external source, such as a web form (simulated using predefined values in this example).
- Compares the retrieved values to predefined correct username and password values.
- Returns 'true' if both the username and password match the correct values, otherwise returns 'false'.
